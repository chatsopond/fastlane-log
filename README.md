### Basic Fastlane commands

- `fastlane actions <action>` or 
  - information for a specific action
  - for example, `fastlane actions produce`
- `fastlane <action> --help`
  - list of action's in-lane Ruby parameters
- `fastlane produce`
  - Create new iOS apps on App Store Connect
- `fastlane cert`
  - Create new iOS code signing certificates
  - `fastlane cert revoke_expired`
    - Revoke the expired certifications
- `fastlane sigh`
  - Generates a provisioning profile, saving it in the current folder
- `fastlane match`
  - Sync the certificates and profiles across the team
- `fastlane match nuke <mode>` 
  - command is used to completely delete (nuke) certificate management data and provisioning profile management data in an Apple Developer account or a Google Play user account. This command is useful when you want to start fresh with certificate and provisioning profile management or when you need to delete problematic data.
  - Please note that the `nuke` command should be used with caution, as deleting data in developer or user accounts is irreversible. Make sure you have backed up any important data before using this command.
  - Example
    - fastlane match nuke distribution 
- `fastlane gym`
  - Automate beta deployments and releases for the iOS apps.
- `fastlane pilot upload`
- `fastlane pilot builds`
  - A list of our uploaded builds and their download counts
- `fastlane pilot list`
  - A list of all testers.
- `fastlane pilot find <email>`
  - Info of the specific tester.

## Prepare for Fastlane

- Install `brew`
  - `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
- Prepare `ruby` with `chruby` and `ruby-install`
  - [Learn more](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51126403/you-dont-have-write-permissions-for-the-library-ruby-gems-2-3-0-directory-ma)
  - `brew install chruby ruby-install`
  - `ruby-install` Install the latest version of ruby, for example, 3.2.2
  - add this commands in `.zshrc`
    - `source /opt/homebrew/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh` (for calling chruby)
    - `source /opt/homebrew/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh` (auto switching)
  - (optional) If you don't remember what version you've been installed, run `chruby`
  - switch to specific ruby version
    - `chruby 3.2.2`
- Install `fastlane`
  - `gem install bundler`
  - `gem install fastlane`
  
## Init Fastlane
In our project, for initializing the fastlane you need to call `fastlane init`

<img width="899" src="Resources/233982732-dc8164d7-4c2b-422b-a39e-07ff6ba3bc67.png">

We will now see the `Gemfile`. This contains fastlane configuration settings, and you'll also see `fastlane` folder which contains `Appfile` and `Fastfile` .
We will create custom lanes in `Fastfile` through this note.

<img width="1032" src="Resources/233984159-501f601c-6df1-4bab-b8c7-5ed6410fc7cc.png">

## Produce

Create new iOS apps on App Store Connect using your command line. [Learn more](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/produce/)

```
fastlane produce \
--username your_apple_id@email.com
--app_identifier com.company.app
--app_name "Your App Name"
--team_name "Your team's name"
--itc_team_name "The name of Apple connect team id"
```

## Platforms & Lanes

In `Fastflie`, you can create custome lanes here. (Ruby syntax)

```rb
platform :ios do
  
  lane :first do
    archive
    sign
    upload
    
  lane :second do
    build_app(scheme: "My App")
    upload_to_testflight
  
end
```

Then in Terminal you can call `fastlane first` to do the `first` lane.

## 2 Example Lanes

We can define `app_identifier`, `apple_id` and `team_id` in Appfile then if there are any required parameters including these three variables we can skip it.

<img width="1136" src="Resources/234202576-47b9f2ed-c541-43f8-aa5e-62979d0f943d.png">

## Match (Team-based code signing)

A new approach to iOS and macOS code signing: Share one code signing identity across your development team to simplify your codesigning setup and prevent code signing issues.

Step
- Run `fastlane match init`
- Choose the storage mode for example, `git`
- Provide the URL of Git Repo

Then, you can see, this has created a new Matchfile with your repo's URL

<img width="1517" src="Resources/234211201-1b683e45-a1b5-4ea1-9579-99d090d265c4.png">

Then, you can run `fastlane match development`, `fastlane match adhoc` and `fastlane match appstore`. This ensure that we'll have these in place

You can now take a look at the results in the repo. With those commands, match has created a full set of team code signing assets that cover all phases of iOS development. Note that all our certificates, along their private keys, live inside a certs folder.

From here on out, whenever anyone on our team needs to set up a new development machine, all they're going to have to do is follow the README.

<img width="1488" src="Resources/234217855-a00e1a41-186f-4b16-99cd-bd85db1f9bf8.png">

You can now fun `match` or create a lane included `match`

```ruby
lane :sync_all_development do
	match(type: "development")
end
```

### Register Devices

Registers new devices to the Apple Dev Portal

```ruby
lane :sync_device_info do
	register_devices(
		devices: {
			"Eiâ€™s iPhone" => "00008120-0**************E"
		}
	)
end
```

## Lane Tips

### Lane Flow Control

Ruby has a very rich collection of flow control operators, this is the simple if-else block

```ruby
lane :my_lane do
	...
	if some_variable == true
		# do something stuff
	else
		# do somthing else
	end
	...
end
```

### Exiting a lane early

We can use `next` keyword to early exit before it reaches the end.

```ruby
lane :my_lane do
	...
	if some_variable == true
		next
	end
	...
end
```

### Lane variables

We can define and use variables.

```ruby
lane :my_lane do
	...
	my_var = "some value"
	some_action(
		parameter: my_var
	)
	...
end
```

### Returning lane values

We can return values by simply placing it in the last line of lane.

```ruby
lane :return_something do
	a_var = 4
	...
	a_var + 2
end
```

and we can use the returned values.

```ruby
lane :use_returned_value do
	...
	new_val = return_something * 10
	...
end
```

### Lane input

We can accept input in a lane.

```ruby
lane :hello_from do |options|
	...
	if options[:who] == "john"
		...
	end
end
```

```ruby
lane :try_hello do
	hello_from(who: "john")
end
```

### Prompting Users

```ruby
lane :prompts do
	UI.messsage "message (usually white)"
	UI.success "message (usually green)"
	UI.error "message (usually red)"
	UI.important "message (usually yellow)"

	# Input
	pw = UI.password("Your password: ") # password inputs are hidden

	# Confirmation
	email = UI.input("Your email: ")
	if UI.confirm("Confirm your email: #{email}")
		UI.success("Confirmed")
		...
	else
		# Stop the process
		next
	end
end
```

### CLI from lane

```
fastlane run some_action a_param: "Hi" b_param: true
```

### Shell from lane

You have the ability within lanes to directly invoke shell commands and retireve thier results

```ruby
lane :hi_shell do
	you = sh "whoami"
	UI.header "Hello, " + you
end
```

### List all lanes

It's natural to want to know at a glance what lanes are available for a given project. Simply call `fastlane list`

<img width="934" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 12 59 47" src="Resources/234772716-92566e64-4332-422b-be41-df820a138385.png">

As well as an annotated one `fastlane lanes`

<img width="934" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 13 05 11" src="Resources/234773587-6b238443-adf2-441b-9925-402f3ef87388.png">

### Private Lanes

```ruby
private_lane :some_action do
	...
end
```

## Test Buildings & Distribution

### Gym

The way to automate beta deployments and releases for your iOS and Android apps.

### Init Gym

The command, `fastlane gym init`, scaffolds a new Ruby Gymfile configuration in our project fastlane subdirectory. As with other fastlane config files, setting here in `Gymfile` effectively serve as project-wide defaults applying to gym in both the command line and in lanes.

```ruby
clean true
scheme "Our Scheme"
```

### Gym Example Lanes

```ruby
desc "Sync your certificates and profiles across your team"
lane :sync_all_development do |options|
	sync_device_info
	selectedType = options[:type]
	match(type: selectedType)
end

desc "Build for App Store submission"
lane :build_appstore do
	sync_all_development(type: "appstore")
	gym(
		output_directory: "build_Appstore",
		export_method: "app-store"
	)
end

desc "Build for Ad Hoc submission"
lane :build_adhoc do
	sync_all_development(type: "adhoc")
	gym(
		output_directory: "build_AdHoc",
		export_method: "ad-hoc"
	)
end
```

## Pilot

The fastlane action that's the way to manage your TestFlight testers and builds from your terminal. Conventionally, uploading an app to TestFligh, you need to manage at `appstoreconnect.apple.com` and manually adjusting internal and external testers each group as you need to. 

### Enable Auto Versioning

[Learn more about automating Version and Build Numbers Using agvtool >](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1827/_index.html)

<img width="1461" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 15 54 36" src="Resources/234813434-7333a543-570b-4b2d-8fc5-e66e158776b9.png">

### Other Test Options

There are a lot of options for other test options. These include long-term option like Crashlytics or HockeyApp. [Learn more >](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/#beta)

### Pilot to AppStore

Set your Apple ID and app-specific password for Fastlane's pilot, you need to set up environment variables. Follow these steps:

1. First, generate an app-specific password for your Apple ID:  
   1. Sign in to the Apple ID website.  
   2. Scroll down to the "Security" section.
   3. Click on "Generate Password..." under "App-Specific Passwords."  
   4. Provide a label for the password (e.g., "Fastlane") and click "Create."  
   5. Copy the generated password.  
2. Set up environment variables:  
   1. Open ~/.bashrc if you're using the Bash shell or ~/.zshrc if you're using the Zsh shell on your computer. Create a new file if it doesn't exist.  
   2. Add the following lines to the open file:   
   ```
   export FASTLANE_USER="your-apple-id-email"
   export FASTLANE_PASSWORD="your-app-specific-password" 
   ```
   3. Replace your-apple-id-email with your Apple ID email and your-app-specific-password with the password you generated in step 1.  
   4. Save and close the file.  
   5. Open a new terminal or run the following command to load the changes:  
   ```
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```
Now, Fastlane's pilot will use the FASTLANE_USER and FASTLANE_PASSWORD environment variables for authentication. Make sure to keep your app-specific password secure, as it can access sensitive information associated with your Apple ID.

## App Submission and Approval

In this section, we will first explore precheck, a Fastlane action that examines app metadata content for potential rejection issues. Next, we'll learn how to generate screenshots for our app across all target devices automatically using Fastlane snapshot. Following that, we'll be introduced to frameit, which allows us to insert each image into a customized device frame. Lastly, we'll discover deliver, a powerful action that manages the entire submission process of these assets directly to the App Store, handling an impressive amount of work.

### Precheck & Metadata

Precheck facilitates the examination of our app metadata proactively for potential issues that might lead to rejection through an automated process. Specifically designed to help us identify and resolve detectable App Store review guideline violations in our apps, Precheck retrieves our app's metadata from the App Store and assesses it for rule violations. These may include mentioning competing platforms, profanities, unreplaced placeholder text, broken URLs, and several other concerns.

It's good to place a parameter in Precheckfile by simply call `fastlane precheck init`

```
app_identifier "com.company.app"
username "appleid@email.com"
team_name "Our team name"
```

### Release Lane

```
lane :release do
	precheck
	UI.success "Successfully precheck..."
end
```

### Snapshot

Fastlane's snapshot is an exceptional tool designed to automate the process of capturing and organizing screenshots for apps, especially when dealing with multiple localizations. Imagine our app is available in 10 languages, requiring a considerable amount of screenshots. Instead of manually capturing and organizing these images, snapshot streamlines the process, making it highly efficient and time-saving. This powerful feature becomes even more valuable when updating our app, as it allows us to effortlessly regenerate and update the screenshots, ensuring they are always up-to-date and accurately representing the latest version of our app.

**Snapshot Setup**
- Create a dedicated Test Target & Scheme for snapshot.
- Run `snapshot init` in Terminal.
  - To generate a custom SnapshotHelper Swift file.
- Add `Snapshot Helper.swift` to your Test Target
- Add a UI Test method to step through app views.
- Call `snapshot()` to take photos.

**snapshot init**

After called `snapshot init`. It will show us the instrustion. We'll need to do follow this instruction.

```
Open your Xcode project and make sure to do the following:
1) Add a new UI Test target to your project
2) Add the ./fastlane/SnapshotHelper.swift to your UI Test target
   You can move the file anywhere you want
3) Call `setupSnapshot(app)` when launching your app

  let app = XCUIApplication()
  setupSnapshot(app)
  app.launch()

4) Add `snapshot("0Launch")` to wherever you want to trigger screenshots
5) Add a new Xcode scheme for the newly created UITest target
6) Add a Check to enable the `Shared` box of the newly created scheme
```

**Snapfile**

```ruby
devices([
	"iPhone SE (3rd generation)",
	"iPhone 14",
	"iPhone 14 Pro",
	"iPhone 14 Pro Max"
])

languages([
  "en-US",
  "th-TH",
])

scheme("Fastlane Snapshots")

# Clean snapshots
stop_after_first_error true
erase_simulator true
clear_previous_screenshots true
reinstall_app true
```

**Example Test File**

```swift
override class func setUp() {
  let app = XCUIApplication()
  setupSnapshot(app)
  app.launch()
}

func testSnapshot() {
  let app = XCUIApplication()
  snapshot("0Launch")
  app.buttons["Home"].tap()
  snapshot("1Home")
  app.buttons["Profile"].tap()
  snapshot("2Profile")
}
```

**Start the snapshot**

To start all works, just simply call `fastlane snapshot` in Terminal. Once it's finish, it will show the screenshot in your browser and all file will be in `screenshots` folder by default.

### Frameit

Fastlane's Frameit feature, a powerful tool that allows you to capture high-quality screenshots for your app and prepare them for the App Store. The process of utilizing Frameit for this purpose will be explained.

Capturing screenshots can be a challenging task, often involving numerous downloads and time-consuming manual processes. Although editing these images in Photoshop is possible, it isn't the most efficient approach, especially for developers looking to focus on their programming skills.

Frameit is a useful tool that specializes in framing your screenshots with style and precision. To make the most of this tool, it's important to familiarize yourself with ImageMagick, a longstanding cross-platform software suite.

This section will guide you through using Frameit and ImageMagick to create visually appealing screenshots for your app, ensuring it stands out in the App Store. By following the information provided here, you can save time and effort while perfecting your app's presentation in a neutral manner.

1. ImageMagick:

To install ImageMagick, visit the official website and download the appropriate version for your operating system: https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php

2. Prepare Your Screenshots:

Before you start framing your screenshots with Frameit, ensure that you have all the necessary screenshots captured for your app. Ideally, you should have images representing key features and functionalities, as well as images showcasing your app on different devices.

3. Configure Frameit:

To use Frameit, you need to create a configuration file called 'Framefile.json' in your project directory. This file will specify settings such as the device frames to be used, the background color, and the text to be displayed on the screenshots.

Here's an example of a basic Framefile.json configuration:

```
{
  "device_frame_version": "latest",
  "default": {
    "title": {
      "color": "#ffffff"
    },
    "background": "./background.png",
    "padding": 50
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "filter": "iPhone 8",
      "frame": "Apple iPhone 8 Space Gray"
    },
    {
      "filter": "iPhone X",
      "frame": "Apple iPhone X Space Gray"
    }
  ]
}
```

4. Run Frameit:

With the Framefile.json file set up, you can now run Frameit. Open a terminal window, navigate to the project directory containing your screenshots and the Framefile.json file, and run the following command:

```
fastlane frameit
```

Frameit will process your screenshots according to the configuration specified in the Framefile.json file.

5. Customize Your Screenshots with ImageMagick:

ImageMagick offers a wide range of image manipulation options. You can use it to resize, crop, or add text overlays to your framed screenshots. For example, to add a watermark to a screenshot, you can run the following command:

```
convert input_screenshot.png -gravity southeast -annotate +10+10 "Watermark Text" output_screenshot.png
```

This command will add the watermark text to the bottom right corner of the input image and save the result as a new file.

Fastlane's Frameit and ImageMagick are powerful tools that can help you create stunning screenshots for your app, ensuring it stands out in the App Store. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can save time and effort while perfecting your app's presentation. Remember to experiment with different configurations and ImageMagick features to achieve the desired look for your app's screenshots.

### Deliver

Deploying an app to the App Store can be a time-consuming process, especially when dealing with metadata, screenshots, and build submissions. Fastlane's Deliver is a powerful tool that automates the process, allowing developers to focus on creating great apps. In this article, we will guide you through the process of using Fastlane's Deliver to streamline your app's deployment to the App Store.

**Set Up Deliver:**

To set up Deliver, navigate to your project directory using the terminal and run the following command:

```
fastlane deliver init
```

This command will create a 'Deliverfile' in your project directory, which is used to configure Deliver. Open the 'Deliverfile' in a text editor and configure the required settings, such as your app's Apple ID and team ID. You can find more information about the available options in the Deliver documentation: https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/deliver/

**Prepare Your Metadata:**

Deliver uses the metadata folder in your project directory to store and manage your app's metadata, including app descriptions, keywords, and release notes. To add or update your app's metadata, navigate to the 'metadata' folder and update the corresponding '.txt' files for each language your app supports. For example, to update the English app description, edit the 'description.txt' file in the 'metadata/en-US' folder.

**Prepare Your Screenshots:**

Place your app's screenshots in the 'screenshots' folder within the 'metadata' folder. Organize the screenshots into subfolders based on the device type, such as 'iPhone 6.5', 'iPhone 5.5', 'iPad 12.9', etc. Ensure that your screenshots are named correctly and are in the required format (e.g., '.png' or '.jpg').

**Submit Your App:**

Once your metadata and screenshots are ready, you can submit your app to the App Store using Deliver. Run the following command in your project directory:

```
fastlane deliver
```

Deliver will verify your metadata, screenshots, and build, and then submit the app for review. You can monitor the submission progress on App Store Connect.

**Update Metadata and Screenshots Only:**

If you only need to update your app's metadata or screenshots without submitting a new build, you can use the following command:

```
fastlane deliver --skip_binary_upload
```

This command will only update your app's metadata and screenshots on App Store Connect, without submitting a new build for review.

Fastlane's Deliver is a powerful tool that can help you streamline your app's deployment process, saving you time and effort. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can automate the submission of your app's metadata, screenshots, and builds to the App Store. This will allow you to focus on creating amazing apps while Deliver handles the deployment process.
